# âœ… Vercel Deployment Fix Applied

## Issue Resolved
The Vercel deployment was failing because the `functions` configuration in `vercel.json` was trying to match a pattern that Vercel couldn't find.

## What I Fixed

1. **Simplified vercel.json** - Removed the problematic `functions` section
2. **Committed changes** - Pushed fix to trigger new deployment  
3. **Verified API structure** - `/api/risk-profile.js` is correctly formatted for Vercel

## Current Status

âœ… **Git**: Changes committed and pushed to main branch
âœ… **API File**: `/api/risk-profile.js` exists and is tracked in git
âœ… **Configuration**: `vercel.json` simplified to avoid pattern matching errors

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Vercel** - Your automatic deployment should now complete successfully
2. **Test API** - Once deployed, test: `https://returnsx.vercel.app/api/risk-profile?phone=+923412524555`
3. **Test Extension** - Place a new COD order to see risk data

## Expected API Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "profile": {
    "riskTier": "ZERO_RISK",
    "riskScore": 92.3,
    "totalOrders": 1,
    "isNewCustomer": true,
    "customerExists": false
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-09-14T...",
  "shop": "your-shop.myshopify.com"
}
```

## Data Flow Confirmation âœ…

Your exact flow is implemented:
1. **Order placed** â†’ Phone extracted from order
2. **Customer check** â†’ API determines if customer exists
3. **New customer** â†’ Marked as LOW RISK (92.3%) automatically  
4. **Existing customer** â†’ Returns actual risk based on history

The deployment should now work! ðŸš€
