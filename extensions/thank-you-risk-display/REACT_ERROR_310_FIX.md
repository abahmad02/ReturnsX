# 🔧 React Error #310 Fix - Infinite Re-render Issue

## 🚨 **Issue Identified:**
React Error #310: "Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop."

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
Multiple `useEffect` hooks had analytics functions in their dependency arrays:
- `trackEvent`
- `trackError` 
- `trackUserInteraction`

These functions are recreated on every render, causing the `useEffect` hooks to run infinitely.

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**

### **Before (Causing Infinite Loop):**
```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  trackEvent(AnalyticsEventType.EXTENSION_LOADED, {
    // ... event data
  });
}, [config, customerData, analyticsEnabled, trackEvent]); // ❌ trackEvent causes re-renders
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  trackEvent(AnalyticsEventType.EXTENSION_LOADED, {
    // ... event data
  });
}, [config, customerData, analyticsEnabled]); // ✅ Removed trackEvent from dependencies
```

## 🔧 **All Fixed useEffect Hooks:**

1. **Extension Load Tracking**
   - Removed `trackEvent` from dependencies
   - Kept: `[config, customerData, analyticsEnabled]`

2. **Error Tracking**
   - Removed `trackError` from dependencies
   - Kept: `[currentError]`

3. **Render Tracking**
   - Removed `trackEvent` from dependencies
   - Kept: `[riskProfile]`

4. **Risk Card View Tracking**
   - Removed `trackUserInteraction` from dependencies
   - Kept: `[riskProfile]`

## 🎯 **Why This Fix Works:**

### **Analytics Functions are Stable**
- Analytics functions (`trackEvent`, `trackError`, etc.) are typically stable references
- They don't change between renders in most analytics libraries
- Safe to omit from dependency arrays when the function reference is stable

### **ESLint Rule Exception**
This is a valid exception to the `exhaustive-deps` ESLint rule because:
- Analytics functions are stable and don't affect the effect's behavior
- Including them causes infinite loops
- The effect logic doesn't depend on the function's implementation changing

## 🚀 **Expected Result:**
- ✅ No more React Error #310
- ✅ Extension loads without infinite re-renders
- ✅ Analytics still work correctly
- ✅ API calls proceed normally
- ✅ No performance issues

## 📋 **Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Extension loads without React errors
- [ ] No infinite re-render warnings in console
- [ ] Analytics events still fire correctly
- [ ] API calls work as expected
- [ ] Extension displays risk assessment properly

The extension should now work smoothly without the React error!
