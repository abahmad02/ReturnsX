- Console method override for production
- Performance and security event logging
- Session tracking and metadata enrichment

**Security:**
- Automatic PII sanitization (emails, phones, credit cards, IPs)
- Stack trace sanitization
- Sensitive key redaction
- HTTPS-only log transmission

### 7. Extension Configuration Updates

**New Production Settings:**
- Environment selection (production/staging/development)
- Rate limiting configuration
- Circuit breaker settings
- Monitoring and alerting options
- Security header configuration
- Audit logging controls
- Data encryption settings

### 8. Environment Configuration

**`.env.production.example`:**
- Complete environment variable template

- Compliance settings

## Security Measures

### 1. Data Protection
- Customer data hashing before API transmission
- PII sanitization in logs and monitoring
- Encrypted authentication tokens
- HTTPS-only communication
- CSP headers for XSS protection

### 2. Access Control
- API token-based authentication
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- IP blocking for suspicious activity
- Circuit breaker for API protection
- Audit logging for compliance

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting
- Real-time error monitoring
- Performance degradation alerts
- Security event logging
- Deployment status notifications
- Health check failures

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Caching
- API response caching (5-minute TTL)
- Session-based cache management
- Efficient cache invalidation
- Memory usage optimization

### 2. Network Optimization
- Request timeout configuration
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Connection pooling
- Compression enabled

### 3. Bundle Optimization
- Production build minification
- Tree shaking for unused code
- Gzip compression
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
