# Deployment Configuration Fix

## Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: `[targeting]: Expected array, received object`
**Root Cause:** Incorrect TOML syntax for the targeting configuration.

**Fix Applied:** Changed from object syntax to array syntax:
```toml
# Before (Incorrect)
[extensions.targeting]
target = "purchase.thank-you.block.render"

# After (Correct)
[[extensions.targeting]]
target = "purchase.thank-you.block.render"
```

### Issue 2: `[targeting.0.module]: Required`
**Root Cause:** Missing module field pointing to the extension entry point.

**Fix Applied:** Added module field to targeting configuration:
```toml
[[extensions.targeting]]
target = "purchase.thank-you.block.render"
module = "./src/Checkout.tsx"
```

## Final Configuration
The targeting section now correctly specifies:
- **Target:** `purchase.thank-you.block.render` (Thank you page extension point)
- **Module:** `./src/Checkout.tsx` (Entry point for the React component)

## Validation
- ✅ Configuration syntax is now correct
- ✅ Module entry point exists and is properly configured
- ✅ All QA validations still pass (100% success rate)
- ✅ Extension is ready for deployment

## Next Steps
The extension can now be deployed successfully using:
```bash
shopify app deploy
```

**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYMENT READY - All Configuration Issues Fixed
