# React Error #310 Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The extension was throwing React error #310, which typically occurs when there are issues with useEffect hooks, specifically:
- Missing dependencies in useEffect dependency arrays
- Infinite re-render loops caused by unstable function references
- useEffect hooks without proper dependency arrays

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Missing useEffect Dependencies
Several useEffect hooks were missing critical dependencies, causing React to warn about potential issues:
- Analytics tracking functions were not included in dependency arrays
- Component performance tracking had missing dependencies

### 2. Unstable Function References
Analytics functions were being recreated on every render, causing useEffect hooks to run unnecessarily.

### 3. useComponentPerformance Hook Issue
The `useComponentPerformance` hook had a useEffect without a dependency array, causing it to run after every render.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed useComponentPerformance Hook
```typescript
// Before: Missing dependency array
useEffect(() => {
  // tracking logic
});

// After: Added proper dependencies
useEffect(() => {
  // tracking logic
}, [isEnabled, trackPerformance]);
```

### 2. Added Missing Dependencies
Updated all useEffect hooks to include proper dependencies:
- `trackEvent`, `trackError`, `trackUserInteraction` functions
- Stable references for analytics functions

### 3. Prevented Duplicate Tracking
Added ref-based tracking to prevent duplicate analytics events:
```typescript
const hasTrackedLoad = React.useRef(false);
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (config && analyticsEnabled && !hasTrackedLoad.current) {
    trackEvent(/* ... */);
    hasTrackedLoad.current = true;
  }
}, [config, customerData, analyticsEnabled, trackEvent]);
```

### 4. Stabilized Config References
Used useMemo to create stable config references:
```typescript
const analyticsConfig = React.useMemo(() => config || {} as ExtensionConfig, [config]);
```

### 5. Enhanced Error Boundary
Improved the ErrorBoundary component to better handle React error #310:
- Added specific detection for React error #310
- Enhanced error logging with component stack traces
- Better error messages for users

## Testing
The fixes address the core issues that cause React error #310:
- Proper useEffect dependency management
- Stable function references
- Prevention of infinite re-render loops
- Better error handling and recovery

## Expected Results
After these fixes:
- No more React error #310 in console
- Stable extension rendering
- Proper analytics tracking without duplicates
- Better error recovery and user experience
- Improved performance due to reduced unnecessary re-renders

## Files Modified
- `src/Checkout.tsx` - Fixed useEffect dependencies and added stable references
- `src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts` - Fixed useComponentPerformance hook
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Enhanced error handling for React errors

The extension should now render properly on the thank you page without throwing React errors.
