# Order Status Extension Testing Guide

## Issue Resolution Summary

✅ **FIXED**: Extension target corrected from `purchase.order-status.block.render` to `purchase.thank-you.block.render`
✅ **DEPLOYED**: Version `returnsx-17` deployed with corrected extension
✅ **DISABLED**: Post-purchase extension disabled to focus only on Order Status

## Testing Steps

### 1. Configure Extension in Shopify Admin

1. Go to your development store's admin
2. Navigate to **Online Store** → **Themes** 
3. Click **Customize** on your current theme
4. In the checkout settings, look for **Thank you page** customizations
5. Add the **Order Status Risk Score** extension
6. Configure API endpoint: `https://returnsx.vercel.app/api/risk-profile`

### 2. Test COD Order (Your Screenshot Case)

1. Place a COD order (like you did - ₹730.74)
2. Complete the checkout flow
3. On the Thank You page, you should now see the risk score extension

### 3. Test Different Risk Scenarios

Based on phone number ending:
- **0, 1, 2** = High Risk (25.5% score, red banner)
- **3, 4, 5, 6** = Medium Risk (65.8% score, yellow banner) 
- **7, 8, 9** = Zero Risk (92.3% score, green banner)

### 4. Verify Extension Shows For

✅ **COD Orders** - Works with all payment methods
✅ **Thank You Page** - Shows after order completion
✅ **All Order Types** - No payment method restrictions

## Extension Configuration

- **Target**: `purchase.thank-you.block.render`
- **Type**: Block extension (configurable position)
- **Payment Methods**: ALL (including COD)
- **Page**: Thank You / Order Status page only

## API Configuration

Your extension will call: `https://returnsx.vercel.app/api/risk-profile?phone=+923412524555`

Make sure your Vercel deployment includes the risk-profile endpoint.

## Troubleshooting

If extension still doesn't show:

1. **Check Theme Customizer**: Extension needs to be manually added to Thank You page
2. **Clear Cache**: Try in incognito mode
3. **Check Console**: Look for any JavaScript errors
4. **Verify API**: Test API endpoint directly in browser

## Expected Behavior

When working correctly, you should see a risk score card below the customer information on the Thank You page, similar to what you saw in previous tests but now specifically for the Order Status/Thank You page scenario.
