# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a Shopify Thank You page extension for the ReturnsX platform. The extension will display customer risk assessment information on the order confirmation page after checkout completion, helping merchants understand customer reliability and providing customers with transparency about their delivery success profile.

The extension targets the `purchase.thank-you.block.render` extension point and will integrate with ReturnsX's existing risk scoring API to provide real-time customer risk information in a user-friendly format.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer who just completed an order, I want to see my delivery reliability score on the Thank You page, so that I understand how my past order behavior affects future purchases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer completes any order (COD or prepaid) THEN the system SHALL display a risk assessment card on the Thank You page
2. WHEN the customer has a phone number in their order THEN the system SHALL use the phone number to fetch their risk profile
3. WHEN the customer has no phone number but has an email THEN the system SHALL use the email to fetch their risk profile
4. WHEN the customer has neither phone nor email THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message for new customers
5. WHEN the risk API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a graceful fallback message without breaking the checkout flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a merchant, I want to see customer risk information displayed to customers on the Thank You page, so that customers are aware of their delivery behavior and may improve their acceptance rates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a high-risk customer (5+ failed deliveries) completes an order THEN the system SHALL display their risk tier and improvement recommendations
2. WHEN a medium-risk customer (2-4 failed deliveries) completes an order THEN the system SHALL display encouragement and tips for maintaining good delivery behavior
3. WHEN a zero-risk customer completes an order THEN the system SHALL display appreciation and confirmation of their trusted status
4. WHEN displaying risk information THEN the system SHALL show the customer's success rate percentage
5. WHEN displaying risk information THEN the system SHALL include actionable recommendations for improvement

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a ReturnsX system administrator, I want the Thank You page extension to integrate securely with our risk scoring API, so that customer data remains protected while providing accurate risk assessments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls to the risk scoring service THEN the system SHALL use proper authentication tokens
2. WHEN customer data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log errors without exposing sensitive information to customers
4. WHEN processing customer identifiers THEN the system SHALL hash phone numbers and emails before API transmission
5. WHEN storing any data locally THEN the system SHALL only store non-sensitive display information temporarily

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer using a mobile device, I want the risk information to be clearly readable and well-formatted on my phone, so that I can easily understand my delivery profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Thank You page on mobile devices THEN the risk card SHALL be responsive and readable
2. WHEN displaying risk tiers THEN the system SHALL use clear visual indicators (colors, icons) for each risk level
3. WHEN showing risk scores THEN the system SHALL display them as percentages with clear labels
4. WHEN presenting recommendations THEN the system SHALL format them as easy-to-read bullet points
5. WHEN the content is too long THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate text truncation or scrolling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Pakistani e-commerce customer, I want to see WhatsApp contact options for high-risk situations, so that I can easily communicate with merchants about my orders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer has high-risk status THEN the system SHALL display a WhatsApp contact button
2. WHEN the WhatsApp button is clicked THEN the system SHALL open WhatsApp with a pre-filled message about order verification
3. WHEN displaying contact options THEN the system SHALL include the order number in the WhatsApp message template
4. WHEN WhatsApp is not available on the device THEN the system SHALL provide alternative contact methods
5. WHEN contact information is displayed THEN the system SHALL respect the merchant's configured support channels

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a merchant, I want to configure the extension settings through Shopify's theme customizer, so that I can control how risk information is displayed to my customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the theme customizer THEN merchants SHALL be able to configure the API endpoint URL
2. WHEN configuring the extension THEN merchants SHALL be able to enable/disable debug mode
3. WHEN setting up the extension THEN merchants SHALL be able to customize risk tier messages
4. WHEN configuring display options THEN merchants SHALL be able to toggle detailed recommendations on/off
5. WHEN saving extension settings THEN the system SHALL validate API connectivity before applying changes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the ReturnsX system, I want comprehensive error handling in the extension, so that checkout flows are never interrupted by extension failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any JavaScript error occurs THEN the extension SHALL catch and log the error without affecting page functionality
2. WHEN API timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL display a fallback message after 5 seconds
3. WHEN invalid API responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate data structure before rendering
4. WHEN network connectivity issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate user feedback
5. WHEN extension configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully without displaying error messages to customers
