# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for debugging and optimizing the Shopify extension's order data retrieval API route to eliminate inconsistent behavior, multiple redundant API calls, and varied response codes. The current system experiences unpredictable API responses (404, 200, 2020) and makes multiple calls when a single successful call should suffice.

The optimization will focus on creating a stable, reliable API interaction mechanism that consistently retrieves customer profile data with a single, successful API call while implementing robust error handling and performance optimizations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Shopify extension, I want to make a single, reliable API call to retrieve order data, so that I can display customer risk information without multiple redundant requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension requests order data THEN the system SHALL make exactly one API call per unique request
2. WHEN an API call is successful THEN the system SHALL return a consistent 200 status code with valid data
3. WHEN the same order data is requested multiple times THEN the system SHALL use cached results instead of making new API calls
4. WHEN request parameters are identical THEN the system SHALL deduplicate requests and return the same response
5. WHEN the API call completes THEN the system SHALL prevent additional calls for the same data within a 5-minute window

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer debugging API issues, I want comprehensive logging and error tracking, so that I can identify the root cause of inconsistent API behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API call is made THEN the system SHALL log the request parameters, timestamp, and unique request ID
2. WHEN an API response is received THEN the system SHALL log the response status, data size, and processing time
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error type, message, stack trace, and request context
4. WHEN multiple calls are detected THEN the system SHALL log a warning with call frequency and timing information
5. WHEN debugging mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed request/response information without exposing sensitive data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent error handling with proper HTTP status codes, so that I can reliably handle different response scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN order data is found THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 200 with properly structured data
2. WHEN order data is not found THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 with a clear error message
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with authentication error details
4. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with validation error information
5. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 500 with sanitized error information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want API call optimization with circuit breaker patterns, so that failed services don't cascade and cause system-wide issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail repeatedly THEN the system SHALL implement a circuit breaker to prevent further calls
2. WHEN the circuit breaker is open THEN the system SHALL return cached data or appropriate fallback responses
3. WHEN service health improves THEN the system SHALL gradually allow requests through (half-open state)
4. WHEN monitoring API health THEN the system SHALL track success rates, response times, and error frequencies
5. WHEN circuit breaker state changes THEN the system SHALL log the state transition with relevant metrics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious application, I want optimized database queries and response caching, so that API calls complete quickly and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying customer data THEN the system SHALL use optimized database queries with proper indexing
2. WHEN the same data is requested THEN the system SHALL serve from cache when available and valid
3. WHEN cache expires THEN the system SHALL refresh data in the background while serving stale data
4. WHEN database queries execute THEN the system SHALL complete within 200ms for 95% of requests
5. WHEN caching responses THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate TTL based on data volatility

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious system, I want proper input validation and sanitization, so that API endpoints are protected from malicious requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving API requests THEN the system SHALL validate all input parameters against defined schemas
2. WHEN processing customer identifiers THEN the system SHALL sanitize and normalize phone numbers and emails
3. WHEN handling order IDs THEN the system SHALL validate format and extract numeric IDs safely
4. WHEN logging request data THEN the system SHALL sanitize sensitive information before logging
5. WHEN returning error messages THEN the system SHALL avoid exposing internal system details

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a monitoring system, I want comprehensive API metrics and health checks, so that I can proactively identify and resolve performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL record response times, success rates, and error counts
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts based on configurable thresholds
3. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL verify database connectivity and API endpoint availability
4. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL provide real-time dashboards for API performance
5. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt recovery procedures
