# 🚀 ReturnsX: COD Risk Management for Pakistani E-commerce

> **Smart risk assessment platform that helps Shopify merchants reduce Cash-on-Delivery return rates through shared customer behavior analytics.**

## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

Pakistan's e-commerce sector faces a **massive COD problem**:
- **30-60% of COD orders** get refused or returned
- **Merchants lose money** on failed deliveries  
- **No shared data** between stores about problematic customers
- **Customers can repeatedly refuse orders** with no consequences

**ReturnsX fixes this by creating a shared "credit score" system for COD customers.**

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Data Collection** 📊
```
Customer places order → Shopify webhook → Hash customer identifiers → Store behavior data
```
- Captures order events: created, cancelled, delivered, refunded
- **Hashes phone/email** for privacy (never stores raw PII)
- Tracks success/failure rates across **all connected merchants**

### 2. **Risk Scoring** 🎯
```
Multi-Factor Algorithm:
├── Failure Rate: failed_attempts / total_orders
├── Return Rate: returns / completed_orders  
├── Time Decay: recent failures weighted higher
├── Volume Adjustment: new customers get grace period
└── High-Value Penalty: expensive order failures hurt more

Result: 0-100 risk score + tier (Zero/Medium/High Risk)
```

### 3. **Checkout Enforcement** 🛡️
```
Customer enters phone at checkout → Real-time risk lookup → Dynamic response:

├── Zero Risk (Green): Normal checkout ✅
├── Medium Risk (Yellow): Merchant review required ⚠️  
└── High Risk (Red): COD blocked, deposit required ❌
```

### 4. **Merchant Dashboard** 📈
- View risk distribution across customer base
- Manage high-risk customers with manual overrides
- Configure risk thresholds per store needs
- Analytics on COD improvement

### 5. **WhatsApp Integration** 💬
- Automated order confirmations for trusted customers
- Verification requests for medium-risk orders  
- Deposit negotiations for high-risk customers
- Payment link generation

## 📊 Sample Data Flow

### Customer Journey Example:
```
1. Ali places ₨2,500 order at Store A → Normal checkout (new customer)
2. Ali refuses delivery → +1 failed attempt recorded
3. Ali places ₨3,000 order at Store B → Medium risk warning
4. Store B ships anyway → Ali refuses again → +1 failed attempt  
5. Ali tries to order ₨1,500 at Store C → HIGH RISK detected
6. COD blocked → Must pay 50% deposit or use card/bank transfer
```

### Risk Score Calculation:
```javascript
Customer Profile: {
  totalOrders: 5,
  failedAttempts: 3,  
  successfulDeliveries: 2,
  returnRate: 60%,    // 3 failures / 5 total orders
  riskScore: 85.5,    // High confidence, recent failures
  riskTier: "HIGH_RISK"
}
```

## 🎮 Testing the Project

### **Quick Setup (5 minutes)**
```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <repo-url>
cd ReturnsX
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 2. Setup database
createdb returnsx_development
echo "DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/returnsx_development" > .env

# 3. Generate database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push

# 4. Start server (ignore TypeScript warnings)
npm run dev
```

### **Test Core Functionality**
```bash
# Test customer profile creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/customer-profiles \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "+923001234567", "email": "test@example.com"}'

# Test risk assessment  
curl http://localhost:3000/api/customer-profiles/{phone-hash}

# View database
npx prisma studio  # Opens at http://localhost:5555
```

### **Test Shopify Integration**
```bash
# Connect to Shopify development store
npm run shopify app dev

# Install app in your development store
# Test webhooks, dashboard, checkout enforcement
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### **Data Protection**
- ✅ **No raw PII stored** - only SHA-256 hashes
- ✅ **GDPR/PDPB compliant** data minimization
- ✅ **TLS 1.2+** for data in transit
- ✅ **Role-based access** control (Admin/Merchant/Shipper)
- ✅ **Comprehensive audit** logging

### **Privacy by Design**
```javascript
// What we NEVER store:
❌ "+923001234567"     // Raw phone number
❌ "john@example.com"  // Raw email address  
❌ "123 Main St"       // Raw address

// What we DO store:
✅ "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."   // SHA-256 hash of normalized phone
✅ "x7y8z9a1b2c3..."   // SHA-256 hash of normalized email
✅ Order success/failure counts and timestamps
```
