# ðŸ”§ Webhook Configuration Fix

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the "Version couldn't be created" error caused by invalid webhook topics:
- `customers/data_request`
- `customers/redact` 
- `shop/redact`

## Root Cause
These GDPR compliance webhooks cannot be configured programmatically through `shopify.app.toml` or the API. They must be set up manually in the Shopify Partner Dashboard.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `shopify.app.toml`
- Removed the problematic GDPR webhook configurations
- Added clear comments explaining they must be configured in Partner Dashboard
- Referenced deployment guide for setup instructions

### 2. Enhanced `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- Added new "Step 4: Configure GDPR Compliance Webhooks in Partner Dashboard"
- Provided detailed instructions for setting up webhooks in Partner Dashboard
- Included specific endpoint URLs to configure

### 3. Verified Webhook Handlers
All GDPR compliance webhook handlers are properly implemented:
- âœ… `app/routes/webhooks.customers.data_request.tsx`
- âœ… `app/routes/webhooks.customers.redact.tsx`
- âœ… `app/routes/webhooks.shop.redact.tsx`

## Next Steps

### Required Action in Partner Dashboard
1. Go to [partners.shopify.com](https://partners.shopify.com)
2. Select your ReturnsX app
3. Navigate to **App setup** â†’ **Compliance webhooks**
4. Configure these endpoints:
   ```
   Customer data request: https://your-domain.com/webhooks/customers/data_request
   Customer redact:       https://your-domain.com/webhooks/customers/redact  
   Shop redact:          https://your-domain.com/webhooks/shop/redact
   ```

### After Configuration
1. Try creating the app version again
2. The error should be resolved
3. Continue with deployment process

## Technical Details

### Webhook Handler Features
- âœ… Proper authentication using Shopify webhook verification
- âœ… Comprehensive logging for audit trails
- âœ… Database operations for data deletion (GDPR compliance)
- âœ… Error handling and appropriate HTTP responses
- âœ… Hashed customer identifier lookups for privacy protection

### Security Compliance
- All handlers return HTTP 200 for successful processing
- Failed requests return appropriate error status codes
- Sensitive operations are logged for compliance auditing
- Customer data is properly anonymized using hashing

## Additional Fix: Invalid Scope Error

### Issue
After fixing the webhook configuration, you may encounter:
```
Validation errors
â€¢ scopes: These scopes are invalid - [read_refunds]
```

### Solution
The `read_refunds` scope doesn't exist in Shopify's API. Refund data is accessed through the `read_orders` scope instead.

**Fixed in `shopify.app.toml`:**
- Removed invalid `read_refunds` scope
- Added comment explaining that `read_orders` includes refund access
- Updated scope list to only include valid scopes

## Verification
The app should now deploy successfully without webhook topic errors or invalid scope errors. These webhooks are mandatory for Shopify App Store approval and are now properly configured for GDPR compliance.
