### Configuration Questions
```
Hi [Name],

Great question about risk score configuration! 

For most Pakistani e-commerce stores, I recommend:
- Zero Risk: 0-25 (allow all payment methods)
- Medium Risk: 26-60 (require confirmation for COD)  
- High Risk: 61-100 (block COD, offer alternatives)

You can adjust these in Settings → Risk Configuration based on your specific business needs.

Would you like me to help you find the optimal settings for your store?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
